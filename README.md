HOW TO USE:
- Select up to three signs of evidence to find a ghost that matches all selected signs. 
- Not all combinations result in a ghost - signs that will result in no matches will be grayed out. 
- Tap any ghost's name for a list of its strengths and weaknesses. If only one ghost remains on the list, its details will be automatically revealed. 
- Click a sign of evidence again to deselect it, or refresh the web page to reset the whole app.

Happy hunting!
